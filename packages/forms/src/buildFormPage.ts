/**
 * Builds an interactive form page with dynamic field behavior based on user progression.
 *
 * This function enhances form elements with UI-specific behaviors needed for a step-by-step form experience:
 *
 * - Progressive disclosure: Fields are shown/hidden based on their relevance to target computations
 * - Focus management: Auto-focuses the first unanswered field when entering a new page
 * - Field dependencies: Disables fields that are no longer relevant for target calculations
 * - Visual cleanup: Automatically collapses irrelevant fields that appear after the last answered question
 *
 * Use this when building multi-step forms where you want to guide users through a sequence of questions
 * while maintaining a clean interface by hiding unnecessary fields.
 *
 * @param page - Array of rule names representing form fields to display
 * @param engine - Publicodes engine instance containing rules and current situation
 * @param targets - Target rules that determine which fields are useful
 * @param lastAnswered - The most recently answered field, used for progressive disclosure
 *
 * @returns Array of form elements enhanced with UI interaction states (hidden, disabled, autofocus)
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // In a form wizard component
 * const pageElements = buildFormPage(
 *   ['person . age', 'person . income'],
 *   engine,
 *   ['taxes . eligible'],
 *   'person . age'
 * )
 * // Returns elements with proper focus/visibility for a form wizard interface
 * ```
