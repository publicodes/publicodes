Improve documentation accessibility:

- increase the contrast of the search field border color;
- implement the ARIA disclosure pattern on the RulePage nav search bar + improve the screen reader UX (add visually hidden messages);
- implement the ARIA disclosure pattern on the Accordion component;
- add a configurable id to target the main content of the documentation page and prevent screen readers from having to traverse the entire docs navigation to reach the main content via a skip link;
- add title attributes to buttons that have no visible label.
