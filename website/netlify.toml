# In the previous version of the website, the current rule selected in the
# Studio was visible as a path in the main site URL such as
# https://publi.codes/studio/my/publicodes/rule
# This is no longer possible with Docusaurus nor really desirable so we
# redirect these old URL format to the studio. It would be preferable to
# keep the rule name and convert it to a `?rule=my.publicodes.rule` query
# parameter but this is not trivial in the Netlify config file.
